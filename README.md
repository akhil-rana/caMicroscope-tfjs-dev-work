# This web app lets user to train two models in the web browser using TF.js with layer customisation and more.
#### 1. Four Shapes Recognition (Square, circle, star and triangle) [dark Filled figures on white backgrounds]
###### ⨀ Dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/smeschke/four-shapes

#### The web app allows a user to add/modify/delete the layers of the model. The user can change different layer parameters according to his needs. The parameters to model.compile() and model.fit() can also be altered accordingly. Training can be performed in the browser itself according to the user provided customisation or optimally(different option provided). After training the user can draw a figure in the canvas or browse for an image to check for prediction.
